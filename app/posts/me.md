Hi, I am Artem Yavorsky (sometimes aqson) - **web consultant** with experience in 3 years.

I love **useful projects**. I don't like useless work even if it help to bring money.

I am **full-stack developer**, that can work as at front-end using javascript/coffeescript with many frameworks, so back-end, especially, using Ruby(Rails/Sinatra), Node.js and Go. Also, I am ready to help with iOS projects using Swift.

I love to use **«trending» approaches** and be a part of its development process. I am contributor in some huge open-source projects like [Exim](https://github.com/hellyeahllc/exim) and [Reactive-coffee](http://yang.github.io/reactive-coffee).

Now, I am working with awesome team - [Hellyeah](http://hellyeah.is). We solve problems related to online businesses and make open-source.

I am traveling, learning law, playing football and love my beautiful girlfriend.
